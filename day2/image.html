    <h2>A motorcycle is broadly defined by law in most countries for the purposes of registration, taxation and rider
        licensing as a powered two-wheel motor vehicle.</h2>
    <p class="pra1">Motorcycle design varies greatly to suit a range of different purposes: long-distance travel, commuting,
        cruising, sport (including racing), and off-road riding. Motorcycling is riding a motorcycle and being involved
        in other related social activities such as joining a motorcycle club and attending motorcycle rallies. </p>
    <p id="pra2">The 1885 Daimler Reitwagen made by Gottlieb Daimler and Wilhelm Maybach in Germany was the first internal
        combustion, petroleum-fueled motorcycle. In 1894, Hildebrand & Wolfm√ºller became the first series production
        motorcycle.</p>
